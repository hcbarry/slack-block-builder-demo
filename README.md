    Take a look at how Block Builder can be used together with Slack's <a href="https://github.com/slackapi/bolt-js">BoltJS</a>
</p>

***

This repository is a lightweight Slack app, built with the the [**Block Builder** library](https://github.com/raycharius/slack-block-builder), and Slack's very own [BoltJS](https://github.com/slackapi/bolt-js). It's a simple implementation whose goal is to demo some of the more complex features of **Block Builder**, such as the `Paginator` an `Accordion` components and how to handle them in pair with [BoltJS](https://github.com/slackapi/bolt-js).
